            <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Jennifer Grace and I'm a software developer and
                animal
                enthusiast.</p>
            <p>I have a busy household with three cats, a dog, and a husband. Never a dull moment!</p>
            <p>I completed my Bachelors of Science in Computer Information Technology. I've been doing software
                development
                for quite a few years but almost four for my employer.</p>
            <p>A majority of my career has been in backend services. I have experience with
                Java, Python, Ruby, and Chef. I've tested based on TDD with cucumber and JUnit.
                I've also used SoapUI and postman with both XML and JSON. The team I am on is currently
                working on created updated API services that will allow us to achieve our services faster
                and more reliably.
